# Monte Carlo Simulation For Pipe Failure

Monte Carlo Simulation is a technique that allows decision-makers to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making. It increases the variability by infusing a wide range of values that are part of the same distribution (values that are in a similar range as actual data) and present with various possible outcomes. Further, there are many iterations sometimes in thousands, and the outcome from each iteration is measured. Simulation outcomes that are backed by domain expertise can assist in making decisions that are more than a hunch or gut and are supported by the data that mimics the possible business scenarios.
